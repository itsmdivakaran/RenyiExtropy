Description: Provides functions to compute Shannon entropy, RÃ©nyi entropy, Tsallis entropy, 
    and related extropy measures for discrete probability distributions. Includes normalized 
    versions and support for various q-orders. Useful for information theory, statistics, 
    and machine learning applications.
